    r"""Set the learning rate of each parameter group using a cosine annealing
    schedule, where :math:`\eta_{max}` is set to the initial value and
    :math:`T_{cur}` is the number of epochs since the last restart in SGDR:

    .. math::
        \begin{aligned}
            \eta_t & = \eta_{min} + \frac{1}{2}(\eta_{max} - \eta_{min})\left(1

        \end{aligned}

    Notice that because the schedule
    is defined recursively, the learning rate can be simultaneously modified
    outside this scheduler by other operators. If the learning rate is set
    solely by this scheduler, the learning rate at each step becomes:

        \cos\left(\frac{T_{cur}}{T_{max}}\pi\right)\right)

    It has been proposed in
    `SGDR: Stochastic Gradient Descent with Warm Restarts`_. Note that this
    only implements the cosine annealing part of SGDR, and not the restarts.
