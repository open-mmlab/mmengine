# Parameter Scheduler

During neural network training, optimization hyperparameters (e.g. learning rate) are usually adjusted along with the training process.
One of the simplest and most common learning rate adjustment strategies is multi-step learning rate decay, which reduces the learning rate to a fraction at regular intervals.
PyTorch provides LRScheduler to implement various learning rate adjustment strategies. In MMEngine, we have extended it and implemented a more general [ParamScheduler](mmengine.optim._ParamScheduler).
It can adjust optimization hyperparameters such as learning rate and momentum. It also supports the combination of multiple schedulers to create more complex scheduling strategies.

## Usage

We first introduce how to use PyTorch's `torch.optim.lr_scheduler` to adjust learning rate.

<details>
<summary>How to use PyTorch's builtin learning rate scheduler?</summary>

Here is an example which refers from [PyTorch official documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html):

Initialize an ExponentialLR object, and call the `step` method after each training epoch.

```python
import torch
from torch.optim import SGD
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ExponentialLR

model = torch.nn.Linear(1, 1)
dataset = [torch.randn((1, 1, 1)) for _ in range(20)]
optimizer = SGD(model, 0.1)
scheduler = ExponentialLR(optimizer, gamma=0.9)

for epoch in range(10):
    for data in dataset:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = 1 - output
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    scheduler.step()
```

</details>

`mmengine.optim.scheduler` supports most of PyTorch's learning rate schedulers such as `ExponentialLR`, `LinearLR`, `StepLR`, `MultiStepLR`, etc. Please refer to [parameter scheduler API documentation](https://mmengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/optim.html#scheduler) for all of the supported schedulers.

MMEngine also supports adjusting momentum with parameter schedulers. To use momentum schedulers, replace `LR` in the class name to `Momentum`, such as `ExponentialMomentum`ï¼Œ`LinearMomentum`. Further, we implement the general parameter scheduler ParamScheduler, which is used to adjust the specified hyperparameters in the optimizer, such as weight_decay, etc. This feature makes it easier to apply some complex hyperparameter tuning strategies.

Different from the above example, MMEngine usually does not need to manually implement the training loop and call `optimizer.step()`. The runner will automatically manage the training progress and control the execution of the parameter scheduler through `ParamSchedulerHook`.

### Use a single LRScheduler

If only one scheduler needs to be used for the entire training process, there is no difference with PyTorch's learning rate scheduler.

```python
# build the scheduler manually
from torch.optim import SGD
from mmengine.runner import Runner
from mmengine.optim.scheduler import MultiStepLR

optimizer = SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)
param_scheduler = MultiStepLR(optimizer, milestones=[8, 11], gamma=0.1)

runner = Runner(
    model=model,
    optim_wrapper=dict(
        optimizer=optimizer),
    param_scheduler=param_scheduler,
    ...
    )
```

If using the runner with the registry and config file, we can specify the scheduler by setting the `param_scheduler` field in the config. The runner will automatically build a parameter scheduler based on this field:

```python
# build the scheduler with config file
param_scheduler = dict(type='MultiStepLR', by_epoch=True, milestones=[8, 11], gamma=0.1)
```

Note that the parameter `by_epoch` is added here, which controls the frequency of learning rate adjustment. When set to True, it means adjusting by epoch. When set to False, it means adjusting by iteration. The default value is True.

In the above example, it means to adjust according to epochs. At this time, the unit of the parameters is epoch. For example, \[8, 11\] in `milestones` means that the learning rate will be multiplied by 0.1 at the end of the 8 and 11 epoch.

When the frequency is modified, the meaning of the count-related settings of the scheduler will be changed accordingly. When `by_epoch=True`, the numbers in milestones indicate at which epoch the learning rate decay is performed, and when `by_epoch=False` it indicates at which iteration the learning rate decay is performed.

Here is an example of adjusting by iterations: At the end of the 600th and 800th iterations, the learning rate will be multiplied by 0.1 times.

```python
param_scheduler = dict(type='MultiStepLR', by_epoch=False, milestones=[600, 800], gamma=0.1)
```

If users want to use the iteration-based frequency while filling the scheduler config settings by epoch, MMEngine's scheduler also provides an automatic conversion method. Users can call the `build_iter_from_epoch` method and provide the number of iterations for each training epoch to construct a scheduler object updated by iterations:

```python
epoch_length = len(train_dataloader)
param_scheduler = MultiStepLR.build_iter_from_epoch(optimizer, milestones=[8, 11], gamma=0.1, epoch_length=epoch_length)
```

If using config to build a scheduler, just add `convert_to_iter_based=True` to the field. The runner will automatically call `build_iter_from_epoch` to convert the epoch-based config to an iteration-based scheduler object:

```python
param_scheduler = dict(type='MultiStepLR', by_epoch=True, milestones=[8, 11], gamma=0.1, convert_to_iter_based=True)
```

Below is a Cosine Annealing learning rate scheduler that is updated by epoch, where the learning rate is only modified after each epoch:

```python
param_scheduler = dict(type='CosineAnnealingLR', by_epoch=True, T_max=12)
```

After automatically conversion, the learning rate is updated by iteration. As you can see from the graph below, the learning rate changes more smoothly.

```python
param_scheduler = dict(type='CosineAnnealingLR', by_epoch=True, T_max=12, convert_to_iter_based=True)
```

### Combine multiple LRSchedulers (e.g. learning rate warm-up)

In the training process of some algorithms, the learning rate is not adjusted according to a certain scheduling strategy from beginning to end. The most common example is learning rate warm-up.

For example, in the first few iterations, a linear strategy is used to increase the learning rate from a small value to normal, and then another strategy is applied.

MMEngine supports combining multiple schedulers together. Just modify the `param_scheduler` field in the config file to a list of scheduler config, and the ParamSchedulerHook can automatically process the scheduler list. The following example implements learning rate warm-up.

```python
param_scheduler = [
    # Linear learning rate warm-up scheduler
    dict(type='LinearLR',
         start_factor=0.001,
         by_epoch=False,  # Updated by iterations
         begin=0,
         end=50),  # Warm up for the first 50 iterations
    # The main LRScheduler
    dict(type='MultiStepLR',
         by_epoch=True,  # Updated by epochs
         milestones=[8, 11],
         gamma=0.1)
]
```

Note that the `begin` and `end` parameters are added here. These two parameters specify the **valid interval** of the scheduler. The valid interval usually only needs to be set when multiple schedulers are combined, and can be ignored when using a single scheduler. When the `begin` and `end` parameters are specified, it means that the scheduler only takes effect in the \[begin, end) interval, and the unit is determined by the `by_epoch` parameter.

In the above example, the `by_epoch` of `LinearLR` in the warm-up phase is False, which means that the scheduler only takes effect in the first 50 iterations. After more than 50 iterations, the scheduler will no longer take effect, and the second scheduler, which is `MultiStepLR`, will control the learning rate. When combining different schedulers, the `by_epoch` parameter does not have to be the same for each scheduler.

Here is another example:

```python
param_scheduler = [
    # Use a linear warm-up at [0, 100) iterations
    dict(type='LinearLR',
         start_factor=0.001,
         by_epoch=False,
         begin=0,
         end=100),
    # Use a cosine learning rate at [100, 900) iterations
    dict(type='CosineAnnealingLR',
         T_max=800,
         by_epoch=False,
         begin=100,
         end=900)
]
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12907710/185116507-660aa0f5-448f-4d9c-a136-0cd647c58564.png)

The above example uses a linear learning rate warm-up for the first 100 iterations, and then uses a cosine annealing learning rate scheduler with a period of 800 from the 100th to the 900th iteration.

Users can combine any number of schedulers. If the valid intervals of two schedulers are not connected to each other which leads to an interval that is not covered, the learning rate of this interval remains unchanged. If the valid intervals of the two schedulers overlap, the adjustment of the learning rate will be triggered in the order of the scheduler config (similar with [`ChainedScheduler`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ChainedScheduler.html#chainedscheduler)).

We recommend using different learning rate scheduling strategies in different stages of training to avoid overlapping of the valid intervals. Be careful If you really need to stack two schedulers overlapped. We recommend using [learning rate visualization tool](TODO) to visualize the learning rate after stacking, to avoid the adjustment not as expected.

## How to adjust other hyperparameters

### Momentum

Like learning rate, momentum is a schedulable hyperparameter in the optimizer's parameter group. The momentum scheduler is used in exactly the same way as the learning rate scheduler. Just add the momentum scheduler config to the list in the `param_scheduler` field.

Example:

```python
param_scheduler = [
    # the lr scheduler
    dict(type='LinearLR', ...),
    # the momentum scheduler
    dict(type='LinearMomentum',
         start_factor=0.001,
         by_epoch=False,
         begin=0,
         end=1000)
]
```

### Generic parameter scheduler

MMEngine also provides a set of generic parameter schedulers for scheduling other hyperparameters in the `param_groups` of the optimizer. Change `LR` in the class name of the learning rate scheduler to `Param`, such as `LinearParamScheduler`. Users can schedule the specific hyperparameters by setting the `param_name` variable of the scheduler.

Here is an example:

```python
param_scheduler = [
    dict(type='LinearParamScheduler',
         param_name='lr',  # adjust the 'lr' in `optimizer.param_groups`
         start_factor=0.001,
         by_epoch=False,
         begin=0,
         end=1000)
]
```

By setting the `param_name` to `'lr'`, this parameter scheduler is equivalent to `LinearLRScheduler`.

In addition to learning rate and momentum, users can also schedule other parameters in `optimizer.param_groups`. The schedulable parameters depend on the optimizer used. For example, when using the SGD optimizer with `weight_decay`, the `weight_decay` can be adjusted as follows:

```python
param_scheduler = [
    dict(type='LinearParamScheduler',
         param_name='weight_decay',  # adjust 'weight_decay' in `optimizer.param_groups`
         start_factor=0.001,
         by_epoch=False,
         begin=0,
         end=1000)
]
```
